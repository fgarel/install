TileMan
=========

Author: Hiroshi Miura, OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan <miurahr@osmf.jp>


Here is a project to maintain tile.openstreetmap.jp tile cache/tile server.
It uses following technologies.

- Nginx Web server (tested on nginx v1.4.1 + lua-module 0.8.1)
  we provide PPA for ubuntu user. You need to select nginx-extras package.
   (need lua module > 0.8.1) or nginx-openresty.

- Tirex, rendering backend 0.4.1

- PostGIS 2.0/postgresql 9.1

- osm2pgsql

- osmosis (recommend v0.40 or later)

It is intended to run on Ubuntu 12.04.2 server but it may be
useful for other platform and who want to run osm tile server.

Design
==

Nginx serves tile proxy. It returns disk cache and escalate to upstream
tile.openstreetmap.org servers when needed.
Lua script included by Nginx controls local rendering.
It is an asumption that postgis server has limited osm data in region.

Lua script retrive x/y/z parameter and check an existence of 
tile data. If it is out of area where the server provided, it goes upstream.

We need another script to maintain tile generation control.
We can get expire.list as "Tile expire method" explaines when importing diff.osm.

Here is a typical configuration

planet import
---

The directory updatedb has an incremental update script and primary load script
for osm data.
It is now defaults geofabrik data and also supposed to use planet.osm.org data. 


Data
====

This distribution includes several tile images.

It can be used to replace some tiles,  where some country law request to 
display specific name.

There are several places where multiple laws in countries requires incoherent 
rules, such as administration claims.

A nginx configuration, statictile provides a solution for these case.
